# ðŸš— Rover Repair Garage: Driving Quiz

---

## Project Overview

Hey there! Welcome to the **Driving Quiz**, a little project we whipped up for Tank's Rover Repair Garage. Now, Tank's a whiz with machines, but he also knows that even the best rovers need **smart drivers** behind the wheel. That's where this quiz comes in!

We designed this interactive Python quiz to be a go-to **tutorial and quick check-up** for new apprentices, or really, anyone who wants to brush up on their driving smarts. Tank's all about "teaching the basics of rover guts," and we figured, why stop there? Let's make sure his crew knows the ropes when it comes to **road safety and general driving rules**, too. Think of it as getting your theoretical driver's license before you even get near one of Tank's incredible machines.

## What it Does

This quiz might be simple, but it's got some neat features to help you learn:

* **Randomized Questions**: Each time you play, the answers for each question get shuffled around. Keeps you on your toes!
* **Instant Feedback**: You'll know right away if you got the answer right or wrong. No waiting around.
* **Track Your Progress**: We keep tabs on your score throughout the quiz, and you'll see your final percentage at the end.
* **Clean & Clear**: The quiz keeps things tidy. Questions pop up one at a time, and the screen clears between them so you can focus.

## How to Get Started

Ready to give it a spin? Here's how:

1.  **Grab the Code**:
    You can find the code for this project on GitHub:
    **[https://github.com/codemaster78/CSAEA-Final-Project](https://github.com/codemaster78/CSAEA-Final-Project)**

    Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
    ````bash
    git clone https://github.com/codemaster78/CSAEA-Final-Project
    ````

2.  **Jump Into the Folder**:
    ````bash
    cd CSAEA-Final-Project
    ````

3.  **Run the Quiz**:
    Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the quiz using:
    ````bash
    python main.py
    ````
    (Since the main file is called `main.py`.)

4.  **Answer Away!**: When a question pops up, just type `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d` for your answer and hit Enter.

5.  **See Your Score**: Once you've gone through all the questions, your total score will show up as a percentage.

## Under the Hood

The project is pretty straightforward, with the main logic contained in one Python file:

* `main.py`: This is where all the magic happens â€“ the questions, the answer shuffling, keeping score, and talking to you.

The `question()` function is the heart of it all. It handles showing you the question and choices, checking your answer, and updating your score. We've just got a series of those calls to lay out the whole quiz.
